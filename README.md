# Cryogenic pool spreading and vaporization

This repository contains Python code for simulating the spill of liquid ammonia (LNH3) or liquid hydrogen (LH2) onto solid ground. 
The scripts use the Python interface of [Clawpack](https://www.clawpack.org) to solve the shallow water equations. 
Several parameters can be varied including initial spill velocity, ground topography, obstructions, and details 
regarding the thermal properties of the substrate. The variable thermal properties of the substrate have been accounted for when 
calculating heat flux from the ground into the liquid pool. Moreover, both boiling correlations and perfect thermal contact have 
been implemented. For more comprehensive information, please refer to: 
[Effect of substrate thermal properties on evaporating liquid hydrogen and ammonia spills (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2025.105685).

After cloning, pip install requirements by typing 
```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
in terminal.
