# Cryogenic pool spreading and vaporization
This repository contains Python code for simulating the spill of liquid ammonia (LNH3) or liquid hydrogen (LH2) onto solid ground. 
The scripts uses the Python interface of [Clawpack](https://www.clawpack.org), called PyClaw, to solve the shallow water equations. 
Several parameters can be varied including initial spill velocity, ground topography, obstructions, and details 
regarding the thermal properties of the substrate. The variable thermal properties of the substrate have been accounted for when 
calculating heat flux from the ground into the liquid pool. Moreover, both boiling correlations and perfect thermal contact have 
been implemented. For more comprehensive information, please refer to the additional details provided in: 
[Spill, evaporation and substrate thermal transport model for liquid H2 and NH3 (2024)](ADD_LINK_TO_PUBLICATION.com).

After cloning, pip install requirements by typing 
```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
in terminal.

Run `main.py` to simulate the spill and generate plots.</p>
